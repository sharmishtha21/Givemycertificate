                                Every year, millions of trees are being cut down to make papers of several ilks. A tree can produce roughly '9000' A4 sheets of paper. With this estimate, there will be huge amount of sacrifice of trees in the time span. As responsible human, we must avoid these circumstances by applying fully digitised certificates for us.<br> Providing certificates like this not only affects forests but it has an adverse effect on the environment as well. Roughly 2-13 liters of water is used to produce an A4 sheet using recovered and recycled paper the water footprint is a bit less but is still an astonishing amount reaching billions of liters of water wasted every year. So, letâ€™s save trees before everything is being wiped out.
