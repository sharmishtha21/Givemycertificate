                                Give My Certificate offer an advanced platform for digital certificate.<br> Our main aim is to digitized the certificate albite old school paper printing. We fully give assurance for the fact that it should be environment friendly as well as carry the same authenticity as the paper document. There is no need to store anywhere or no chance of being stolen. The entire process is highly secure and people can download the document when they want. While there is digitization in every aspect of our life we still use certificates printed on paper wasting precious natural resources we aspire to offer a centralized platform for the same. Institution can ask us to generate these certificates and we generate corresponding e-certificates which are cheaper, readily available, environment friendly and consume less time to make.
