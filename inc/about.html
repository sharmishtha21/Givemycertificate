                                Give My Certificate offer an advanced platform for digital certificate.<br> Our main aim is to digitise the certificate albite old school paper printing. We give full assurance for the fact that it is environment friendly and will carry the same authenticity as the paper document. There won't be any need to physically store it anywhere or no chance of being stolen. The entire process is highly secure and an individual would be able to download the document whenever they want.
                                While there is digitisation in every aspect of our life, we still use certificates printed on paper, wasting precious natural resources. We aspire to offer a centralised platform for the same. Institutions can simply contact us and we will generate the e-certificates which will also prove to be way cheaper than the printed ones. At the same time, they are readily available, environment friendly and consume less time to make.
